// VAO stores the state/configuration of how vertex attributes are read from the VBO(s). To remember how vertex data is laid out, so you don’t have to re-specify attribute pointers every time.
// Unless the data layout is different, we only need one VAO. VAO is used to tell the GPU how to read the memory stored.
// E.g. The first 3 is position, next 3 color etc. so VAO remembers this layout so the GPU knows how to read it each time.
